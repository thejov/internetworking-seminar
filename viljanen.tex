\section{Introduction}

Nature has a way of solving complex problems in pragmatic, efficient and elegant ways. There is a lot that we can learn and try to adapt into similar issues in totally different fields like computing and networking. One can find analogies between the different players and functions of a specific system in nature and a technical problem in e.g. the networking domain \cite{dressler2010bio}. Inspiration has classically been drawn from higher level understanding of biological systems in nature \cite{kroeker2011biology}. A good example of this is how the sophisticated way ants use for foraging has offered offered means for the AntNet routing protocol to function more efficiently and without a outside controlling unit \cite{dressler2010bio}. Today also solutions from low level biological systems, like molecular systems, are adapted to the field of computer science \cite{kroeker2011biology}. The neurologic development of fruit-flies has inspired a minimalistic and efficient algorithm for self-organizing distributed networks \cite{kroeker2011biology}.

\subsection{What is Bio-inpired networking?}
Bio-inpired networking is one of the three main areas, where bio-inspired approaches are used. The other areas are Bio-inspired computing and Bio-inspired systems. They are all technical solutions that draw their inspiration from nature. Bio-inspired computing tries to find effective computation algorithms for e.g. optimization processes or pattern matching. Bio-inspired systems stands for system architectures of massivley distributed, collaborative systems. Bio-inspired networking concentrates on finding solutions for efficient and scalable networking and autonomous organizing in a distributed environment. \cite{dressler2010bio}

\subsection{What makes Bio-inspired approaches attractive?} 
Bio-inspired approaches offer qualities that can be found attractive in the networking field. They can offer feasable solutions for achieving the demanding charasteristics of next generation network architectures. These are the dynamic nature of mobile and ad-hoc networks and cognitive radionetworks, autonomous operation in a infrastructureless network and communication in nano and micro scale networks \cite{dressler2010bio}. In large, heterogenous networks the most efficient solutions do not usually include a centralized controlling entity, but favor a self-organizing, learning and evolving type of agents traversing and finding optimal routes through the network \cite{dressler2010bio}.

Biological systems often have a small set of simple rules that can be used to create complex behavior \cite{dressler2010bio} for solving challenging problems. These solutions usually include qualities like self-organizing \cite{kroeker2011biology}, adapting to changing environmental conditions, fault tolerance, efficient management of scarce resources, collaborating and surviving harsh conditions \cite{dressler2010bio}.
